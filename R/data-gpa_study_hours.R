#' gpa_study_hours
#'
#' A tibble with 193 rows and 2 columns. The columns represent the
#' variables \code{gpa} and \code{study_hours} for a sample of 193
#' undergraduate students who took an introductory statistics course in 2012 at
#' a private US university.
#'
#' GPA ranges from 0 to 4 points, however one student reported a GPA > 4. This
#' is a data error but this observation has been left in the dataset as it is
#' used to illustrate issues with real survey data. Both variables are self
#' reported, hence may not be accurate.
