#' Textbook data for UCLA Bookstore and Amazon
#'
#' A random sample was taken of nearly 10\% of UCLA courses. The most expensive
#' textbook for each course was identified, and its new price at the UCLA
#' Bookstore and on Amazon.com were recorded.
#'
#' The sample represents only courses where textbooks were listed online
#' through UCLA Bookstore's website. The most expensive textbook was selected
#' based on the UCLA Bookstore price, which may insert bias into the data; for
#' this reason, it may be beneficial to analyze only the data where \code{more}
#' is \code{"N"}.
