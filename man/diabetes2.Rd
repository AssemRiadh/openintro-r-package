\description{
Three treatments were compared to test their relative efficacy
(effectiveness) in treating Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were
being treated with metformin. The primary outcome was lack of glycemic
control (or not); lacking glycemic control means the patient still needed
insulin, which is not the preferred outcome for a patient.
