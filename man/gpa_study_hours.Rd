\description{
A tibble with 193 rows and 2 columns. The columns represent the
variables \code{gpa} and \code{study_hours} for a sample of 193
undergraduate students who took an introductory statistics course in 2012 at
a private US university.
}
\details{
GPA ranges from 0 to 4 points, however one student reported a GPA > 4. This
is a data error but this observation has been left in the dataset as it is
used to illustrate issues with real survey data. Both variables are self
reported, hence may not be accurate.
