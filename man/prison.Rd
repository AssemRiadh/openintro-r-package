\description{
Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment
involving an "isolation" experience. The goal of the experiment was to find
a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores. This score
measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and
it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
