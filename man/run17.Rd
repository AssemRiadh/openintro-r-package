\description{
Details for all 19,961 runners in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Run, which is an
annual road race that takes place in Washington, DC. Most runners
participate in a 10-mile run while a smaller fraction take part in a 5k run
or walk.
}
\details{
There was a time limit where all 10 Mile racers had to finish by. Can you
figure out what that time is?
