\title{Textbook data for UCLA Bookstore and Amazon}
\format{A tibble with 73 observations on the following 7 variables.
\describe{\item{deptAbbr}{Course department (abbreviated).}
\item{course}{Course number.} \item{ibsn}{Book ISBN.}
\item{uclaNew}{New price at the UCLA Bookstore.}
\item{amazNew}{New price on Amazon.com.} \item{more}{Whether
additional books were required for the course (\code{Y} means "yes,
additional books were required").} \item{diff}{The UCLA Bookstore
price minus the Amazon.com price for each book.} }}

\description{
A random sample was taken of nearly 10\% of UCLA courses. The most expensive
textbook for each course was identified, and its new price at the UCLA
Bookstore and on Amazon.com were recorded.
}
\details{
The sample represents only courses where textbooks were listed online
through UCLA Bookstore's website. The most expensive textbook was selected
based on the UCLA Bookstore price, which may insert bias into the data; for
this reason, it may be beneficial to analyze only the data where \code{more}
is \code{"N"}.
